scan through 18000 files user ratings for each movie
scan through movie titles

put these into one cache.txt file
save it into a file with cPickle

load from cache.txt into data structure

general solution:
------------------
1. grab block of requests from probe (movie: user(s)) // optimal?
2. get movie average rating
3. get user average rating for all users
4. compute user rating from:
  (movie average * variance modifier + user average* user modifier)
  where variance modifier + user modifier = 1.0
5. store answer, compare it to given solution, add abs(difference)^2 to diff
  accumulator, add 1 to size accumulator
6. after all tabulations, perform RMSE on diff/size (sqrt of mean)
7. output solutions with RMSE at the end to std:out
